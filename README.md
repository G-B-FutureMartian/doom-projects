# doom-projects

My custom doom wads.
# CAVE.wad

You fall into a cave with pistol. Escape!
# GLADIATOR.wad

You are dropped into a modern gladiator fighting pit. Can you survive? Win? __revenge__?
# BOSH_RUSH.wad

You must fight waves and waves of enemies.
# Info
So far, all of these wads use the freedoom2 iwad. You can download that here: https://freedoom.github.io/download.html
These are tested and work on lzdoom (so they should work with gzdoom and zdoom) and DSDA-Doom well,
though some things, like titles of maps, don't work in DSDA.
